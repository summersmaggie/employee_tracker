A Sinatra application to track employees, the current division they work in, and the current project they're working on.

## Behavior
1. As an HR manager, I want to be able to create divisions in the company (HR, IT, Sales, etc).
2. As an HR manager, I want to be able to list, update, and delete divisions.
3. As an HR manager, I want to be able to add employees and assign them to a division. An employee will belong to one division and a division will have many employees.
